Feature: Participants administration

  As a [role]

  So that [benefit]

  The story above is to set context for the reader. It doesn't actually have any impact on the test
  itself. The phrases inside the scenarios are ties to test code using regex, which you can see in
  /tests/features/step_definitions/steps.js

  In this textual part of the file, you can include context about this feature, you can add links to
  external documents and whatever is needed to create the full specification.
